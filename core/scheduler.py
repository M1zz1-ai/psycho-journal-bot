"""Reusable async loops — the cron pattern for crypto/report bots.

Two shapes:

- :func:`run_interval` — every N seconds, measured from process start. Right for
  polling ("check again in 60s"), WRONG for anything the user experiences as a
  time of day.
- :func:`run_daily_at` — the next occurrence of a wall-clock time in a given
  timezone. A unit restarted at 15:00 still fires at 11:00, because the target
  is computed from the clock, not from when the process happened to boot.

Mirrors gmail-bot-py's poll loop: each cycle is wrapped in core.errors
resilience so a single failure is logged/alerted and the loop keeps running.
``asyncio.CancelledError`` stops it cleanly (for shutdown).
