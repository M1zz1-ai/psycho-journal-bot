"""Reusable async interval loop — the cron pattern for crypto/report bots.

Mirrors a prior bot's poll loop: run a coroutine every N seconds, each cycle
wrapped in core.errors resilience so a single failure is logged/alerted and the
loop keeps running. ``asyncio.CancelledError`` stops it cleanly (for shutdown).
