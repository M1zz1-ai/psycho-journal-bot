"""Markdown → Telegram-safe HTML for LLM replies.

``core.tg.TelegramClient`` sets a bot-wide ``parse_mode="HTML"``, so every
message body is parsed as HTML by Telegram. LLMs emit Markdown by habit, which
produces two distinct bugs:

1. Cosmetic — ``**bold**`` leaks verbatim because asterisks mean nothing in HTML.
2. Fatal — a reply containing ``&`` or ``<`` is rejected by the Bot API with
   ``can't parse entities``, and the send raises. A project named
   "Schedule & Secretary" is enough to do it, and the symptom (no message at
   all) reads as the bot going mute rather than as a formatting bug.

The house approach is CONVERT, not instruct. Telling the model "emit HTML" fixes
(1) but leaves (2) live, because it is then the model's job to remember to write
``&amp;`` inside prose — a rule it will follow most of the time, which is the
worst kind of reliability for a crash. Here escaping is unconditional and
happens before any tag is introduced, so the output cannot carry an unescaped
metacharacter no matter what the model wrote.

Malformed NESTING is the same crash wearing a different hat: Telegram rejects
``<b><i>x</b></i>`` with the very same ``can't parse entities`` and drops the
whole message. Markdown emphasis is not a grammar — a task title carrying an
unbalanced ``**``, interpolated into a ``*…*`` stanza, is enough to interleave —
so the converter checks its own output before returning it and falls back to
plain escaped text when the nesting is broken. Same tradeoff as above: a reply
that arrives with visible asterisks beats a reply the user never sees.

Telegram's HTML is NOT a subset of HTML you can guess at — it is a fixed tag
list, verified against aiogram 3.29's entity decorator (``aiogram.utils.
text_decorations.HtmlDecoration``), which is generated from the Bot API entity
spec: ``b i u s code pre a tg-spoiler tg-emoji blockquote``. There is no
``<h1>``, no ``<ul>``/``<li>``, no ``<br>``, no ``<p>``. Headings therefore
render as bold lines and bullets as a literal "•" character — emitting list
tags would be rejected outright. Escaping is ``&``/``<``/``>`` only (quotes are
left alone), matching ``HtmlDecoration.quote``.
